# YorkIEEE
A stylesheet for EndNote to comply with University of York guidelines

Thanks to Chris Lawrence for making this. I (Tom) am merely a custodian.

This project aims to support users of EndNote who are also engineering students of 
the University of York keep and track their references more easily and efficiently.
It was started by Chris generously sharing his stylesheet with me during our
first assignment on the Computer Science MSc. I hope many people use it. I hope
it saves you hours of time like it has for me! Use a reference manager! Thanks again, Chris!

## Before you begin

### Warning

I have only used this with EndNote 20. It should work with EndNote 9, but please
let me know. Should this stay or should this (warning) go??

### MS Word / Office suite

If you are using MS Word, please install the EndNote Word plugin! It will 
make your life easier, and therefore objectively better, unless you love the hard life.

### Google docs

Please update this section with a pull request or an email to me 
if you use EndNote with Google docs!!! 

### Before you use this stylesheet

Please *always* check your references manually!! University of York's IEEE guide is
[here](https://subjectguides.york.ac.uk/referencing-style-guides/ieee)

[Information for installing EndNote](https://www.york.ac.uk/it-services/software/a-z/endnote/#tab-1) 
(with a University of York license if you are a student)

## Installation.

You can just download the file and double click it. If you do, books references should work 
fine. But please read the next section to setup your EndNote installation first if you need 
to reference articles and web pages.

### Different from standard IEEE

For Journal articles, websites (with author) and websites (without author) 
and perhaps other reference types, University of York ask for the month 
accessed to be specified. And require a custom made output style.

### Add month field

In EndNote go to the menu: Edit -> preferences
This brings up a dialogue box.
Click the Modify reference types box.

#### Journal Article

Click on the dropdown menu of reference types.
Select Journal article.
Scroll down the list to find the Custom 1 field.
If the field is blank enter Month here in the right hand column.
If the field is not blank enter Month in the next blank Custom field.
Click Ok.

#### Website (with author)

Click the dropdown menu for reference types.
Select website
As journal article scroll down to find Custom fields.
In custom1 on the right add 'Day Accessed' (without quotation marks).
In custom2 add 'Month Accessed' (without quotation marks).
In custom 3 add 'Year Accessed' (without quotation marks).
In custom 4 add 'Day Published' (without quotation marks).
In custom 5 add 'Month Published' (without quotation marks).
In custom 6 add 'Name of overall website' (also without quotes).
Click Ok.

#### Website (with no author)

You probably don't have this already so:
Click the dropdown menu for reference types.
Select Unused 1
In Generic on the right add 'Web Page with no author' (no quotes)
In Author add 'Organisation' (no quotes)
In Title add 'Title'  (no quotes)
In Custom 1 add 'Day Accessed' (no quotes)
In Custom 2 add 'Month Accessed' (no quotes)
In Custom 3 add 'Year Accessed' (no quotes)
In Custom 4 add 'Name of overall website' (no quotes)
Click Ok. 

...Drink tea! お疲れ様でした！
